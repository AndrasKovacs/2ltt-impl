\frametitle{Regions}

Example: list in a local region.
\begin{verbatim}
  sum : {R : Region} → List R Int → Int
  sum xs := case xs of nil → 0; cons x xs → x + sum xs

  countDown : {R : Region} → Int → List R Int
  countDown x := case x of 0 → nil
                           n → cons x (countDown (x - 1))

  f : Int → Int
  f x :=
    let R : Region
    let xs : List R Int := countDown x
    sum xs
\end{verbatim}
